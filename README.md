Software allowing interpolation of the peak black-body flare temperature using the normalized peak flare amplitude, and effective temperature of the star. The grid is designed for use with main-sequence stars that have temperatures ranging from 2700 K to 8600 K.

  Usage: flaremaxtemp.py <-teff=float> <-ampl=float>

         option -teff : effective temperature of the star.
                -ampl : amplitude of the stellar flare.
