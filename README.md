Software allowing interpolation of the peak black-body flare temperature using the normalized peak flare amplitude, and effective temperature of the star. The grid is designed for use with main-sequence stars that have temperatures ranging from 2700 K to 4600 K (spectral type K4V). If you find this sofware useful and you use the results in your scientific work please cite the paper [Bicz et al. 2025](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2025/07/aa52867-24/aa52867-24.html).

  Usage: flaremaxtemp.py <-teff=float> <-ampl=float>

         option -teff : effective temperature of the star.
                -ampl : amplitude of the stellar flare.
